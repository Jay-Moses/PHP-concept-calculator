This project implements a versatile calculator application using PHP scripts. It can perform various mathematical operations, including:

Basic arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
Exponentiation (raising a number to a power)
Percentage calculation
Square root
Logarithm
The application provides a user-friendly web interface for inputting values and selecting the desired operation.

Features:

User-friendly web form for input and selection
Support for basic and complex mathematical calculations
Clear output display
Implementation:

The application utilizes PHP scripts to handle calculations and user interaction. Separate functions are implemented for each supported operation. The web form utilizes HTML and potentially CSS for styling.

Testing Instructions:

Ensure you have a PHP development environment set up (e.g., Apache server with PHP module).
Clone or download the project repository from GitHub (link to be provided upon submission).
Open the index.php file in a web browser (usually http://localhost/[project_directory]/index.php).
Enter numerical values in the provided fields.
Select the desired operation from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Calculate" button.
The application should display the calculated result.
Deliverables:

PHP scripts for the calculator application
HTML form for user input and result display
Documentation outlining the implementation approach (this README.md file)
